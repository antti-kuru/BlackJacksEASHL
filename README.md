This is my project for the course Software Development Skills: Front-End 2024-25

This website is created for NHL Esports team The Black Jacks which I'm part of. The idea is to showcase the key information of our team
such as recent news, roster, video highlights, and so on. All the data in the website hardcoded as this is only done as a frontend so there is no
server where all the data would be fetched from in the backend.

I found this project very interesting and I'm going to update it going forward.

The deployed webiste can be accessed here: https://antti-kuru.github.io/BlackJacksEASHL/index.html
