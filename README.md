This is my project for the course Software Development Skills: Front-End 2024-25

The coursework can be accessed here: https://github.com/antti-kuru/frontendcourse_coursework

This website is created for NHL Esports team The Black Jacks which I'm part of. The idea is to showcase the key information of our team
such as recent news, roster, video highlights, and so on. As this is only front end project, there is no real database or server. All data is fetched from data folder where handmade JSON files are located.

I found this project very interesting and I'm going to update it going forward.

The deployed webiste can be accessed here: https://antti-kuru.github.io/BlackJacksEASHL/index.html
